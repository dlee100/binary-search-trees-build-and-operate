# binary-search-trees-build-and-operate
In this assignment you are asked to create a Python program in aJupyter notebook that reads a transaction stream that builds and operates a Binary Search Tree (BST) based on the stream.  This will involve building and operating one or more trees in succession.  To do that the program reads a stream of transactions that can perform several types of operations. The transactions include a transaction code and a numeric data node value to be stored in the BST.
